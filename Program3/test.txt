Bob#I am testing the word wrap faeture. This text should be wrapped whenever it is displayed. However, it is not wrapped when I am typing it.

Anyway, this text should be long enough to test the word wrap feature.#1#8#Bobland#0#10#42#29#21#Cockatrice#A flying part-rooster/part-snake that could kill with its stare.#8#10#England#1#4#12.4#21.5#12#Sylph#An invisible, fairy-like being dedicated to the element of air.#1#6#Greece#0#5.5#10#15.8#10#Bogle#A ghostly being whose purpose is to confuse and scare humans and other creatures.#1#5#England#1#6#9#21.2#31.32#
