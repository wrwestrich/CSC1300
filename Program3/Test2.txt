Bob#I am testing the word wrap faeture. This text should be wrapped whenever it is displayed. However, it is not wrapped when I am typing it. Fixing that is not in the asiganment, so I will not bother at all with doing anything with that. Anyway, this text should be long enough to test the word wrap feature.#1#8#Bobland#0#10#42#29#21#
