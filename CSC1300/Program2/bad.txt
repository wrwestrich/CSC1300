Someone got into you bank account and stole some money!
You spent all day on a program just to realize you have no idea what you’re doing.
Someone outright hated you today! Normal stuff for you, really.
You just noticed your massive lack of friends! :,(
Someone on the street looked at you in disgust! Happens all the time.
You found a stray cat that let you pet it, but it was all a bait and it scratched off your hand!
Someone tricked you into thinking your shoes were untied, but you’re wearing slip-on shoes.
You took more than an arrow to the knee… needless to say, you are no longer an adventurer.
You don’t visit the Could District very often.
One does not simply walk into Mordor.
Someone thought you were homeless and laughed at you. People are terrible.
You went to gamble and lost everything you own.
Your car broke down and it took 2 years for AAA to come help you. A normal response time for AAA, however.
You downloaded more RAM for your computer, but needed up getting a virus! You should stick to less shady RAM downloading services.
Your mousepad crashed because it was running an old operating system.
You polled the IP address 127.0.0.1 and got no response.
You didn’t bring your umbrella and you definitely needed it.
You made friends with Warren Buffet! Unfortunately, you found out how he really makes his money…
You tripped and fell into an endless pit, forever doomed to fall and contemplate your entire existence for the rest of your life.
Nothing bad actually happened. I just don’t like you.
